a1: displacement in the z-direction of joint one from the ground (i.e height) 
a2: displacement from the axes of rotation from Motor 1 to Motor 2 
a3: displacement in the z-direction from joint 1 to joint 2 (in this case 0 because both are at the same height)
a4: the displacement from the axis of rotation from Motor 2 to the tool tip



a1 = 6.2  # length of link a1 in cm
a2 = 5.2  # length of link a2 in cm
a3 = 0  # length of link a3 in cm
a4 = 7  # length of link a4 in cm
